# Spuds-Journey-Home

## Introduction
Spud's Journey Home is a top-down exploration game incorporating basic 2-D physics built using the PyGame library. I made this game for an assignment in my first year game design course at Carleton University (COMP1501). Hope you enjoy it!

## Folders to be included
The following folders need to be at the same file level as the game_main.py file for it to run:
 - Characters
 - Map
 - Spud
 - Text
 - Tiles
 - Music
 
 ## Requirements
 The game runs on Python 3.8.  
 Make sure you have PyGame installed (see https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted for more information).
